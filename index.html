          <h3>Katrina</h3>
          <p>When Kat was still in high school she began doing her friends hair, and she never thought of doing anything else professionally. She taught herself updo’s and had plenty of  willing and happy heads to let her practice!  Beauty School was the next step, and she enrolled after graduating. What started as a passion, has turned her into a stylist who loves the beauty industry, and the ever changing trends.  Even more than that she appreciates the emotional experience of giving her clients… “the happiness that people feel about themselves”.

          <h3>Morgan</h3>
            <p>
              Morgan is celebrating her twelfth year as a stylist. She studied at Toni and Guy Hairdressing Academy, because she wanted a career where she could use her artistic style, and share it with the world. Not only is Morgan a stylist at KMS, she is also our manager. .  Being a problem solver as well as working easily under pressure gives her a great advantage. Like our other stylists, she is motivated by the finished result she’s able to give a client, and enjoys the creative process to get there. Extensions are a specialty as well as color, highlights, and haircuts.
